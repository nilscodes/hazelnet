# ðŸ”² /profile toggle

Make Vibrant do what you want it to by using <mark style="background-color:orange;">/PROFILE TOGGLE</mark>. This command lets you control individual settings and preferences across all your servers. Simply select the the setting you want to change from the dropdown menu at the bottom to switch it on or off, respectively. The message content will update and always show you your current settings.

The following settings are currently available:

### Receiving pings from other users

By default, Vibrant will try to send you a Direct Message if someone pings you with <mark style="background-color:orange;">/PING SEND</mark>. If you would like to turn DMs off for this kind of ping, you can change this setting here. Regardless of this being turned on or off, you can always see your recent pings with <mark style="background-color:orange;">/PING LIST</mark>.
