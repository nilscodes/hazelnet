If you would like to learn more about <mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark>, use the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/PREMIUM</mark> command and also head to [our Premium page](https://www.vibrantnet.io/premium). It will show the current premium status of your account, your available HAZEL balance and which servers you have pledged your delegation to.

Having <mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark> will remove any advertisements from your daily bot interactions, automatically make you eligible for redeeming our governance token HAZEL, and you will be entered into an NFT giveaway every epoch, without needing to do anything else. The current giveaway and latest winners will also be visible via the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/PREMIUM</mark> command. Being a premium member will also allow access to exclusive whitelists projects will have for <mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark> members.

You will also be able to pledge your delegation to a server (or remove your pledge) by running the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/PREMIUM</mark> command on the respective server and clicking the button at the bottom. This indicates you support the project running this Discord server and it will give them a Vibrant discount and comes at no cost for you.
