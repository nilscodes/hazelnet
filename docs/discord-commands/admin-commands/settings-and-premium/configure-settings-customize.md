<mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark>

With <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-SETTINGS CUSTOMIZE</mark> you can make Vibrant look like a native bot in your server! The command will let you define various aspects of the bot design and branding for all messages sent to users by the bot. This includes ephemeral Discord messages in responses to users running verifications or signing up for whitelists, but also public announcements like for polls and giveaways or whitelists. See the image below for the different customizable elements and the table underneath for a detailed explanation of each item.

&#x20;You can rename the bot in your server without having Black Edition by simply right clicking the bot user and selecting Change Nickname. Unfortunately, due to Discord limitations, it is currently not possible to change the bot logo itself. Should you need that level of customization, reach out to our team for a dedicated instance.

&#x20;Administrative commands will always use red and the dedicated Vibrant administration logo instead of your branded design, to make sure administrative command responses can be clearly told apart from when you use user-visible commands.
