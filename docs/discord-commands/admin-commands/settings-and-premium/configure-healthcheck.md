Use <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-HEALTHCHECK</mark> whenever something is not working as expected with your bot. The command will analyze various common scenarios that cause issues, like role assignments not being high enough. After running the command, you will be provided with a clean health bill or a list of problems you should address to get your server into best shape again.
