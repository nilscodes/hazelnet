# ðŸ”‹ /configure-premium refill

Running <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-PREMIUM REFILL</mark> will provide you with the payment details to refill your premium account balance. Simply provide your desired refill amount (5 ADA minimum) and you will be given an exact amount to send to our handle to refill your balance. After the payment was made, it takes a few minutes for your balance to update accordingly. You can cancel the payment request by running this command again or check your current balance via the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-PREMIUM STATUS</mark> command.
