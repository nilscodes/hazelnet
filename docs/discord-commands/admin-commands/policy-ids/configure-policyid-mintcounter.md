description: Track your mint count in Discord
---

# ðŸ”¢ /configure-policyid mintcounter

If you need to track how many items are minted on a specific policy, you can simply turn any voice channel into a counter. Run /CONFIGURE-POLICY MINTCOUNTER and designate which channel and policy ID to track, and you are good to go! Optionally, you can set up the maximum count if you are targeting a number that corresponds to selling out.

&#x20;The bot will continuously need the View Channel, Manage Channel and Connect permissions to the respective voice channel to be able to update its name. The name change to the current mint count happens every five minutes at most, due to the rate limits that Discord has put in place.
