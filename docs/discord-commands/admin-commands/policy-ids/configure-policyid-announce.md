# ðŸ“¢ /configure-policyid announce

Most serious NFT projects on Cardano have a dedicated channel to show what their official policy IDs are. Are you tired of maintaining that post yourself? We understand. We allow you to manage your own list of official policy IDs and associated projects and with our command <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-POLICY ANNOUNCE</mark> you can even post the entire project list into a dedicated announcement, no hassle, no additional work. You can even include a text to guide users with additional information!

ðŸ’¡ The announcement will include all policies included in <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-POLICY LIST</mark>. Make sure you are only adding your own projects to this list.
