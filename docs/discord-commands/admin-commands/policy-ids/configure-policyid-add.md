description: Add a policy ID to the list of official projects
---

# âž• /configure-policyid add

Use /CONFIGURE-POLICY ADD to add a policy ID and project name to your project list. The list will be available to your users via the [/POLICYID](https://www.vibrantnet.io/documentation/policyid) command.

In addition to being listable for end users, the bot will use the readable name of your project whenever it references a policy ID you have defined, like when using the [/CONFIGURE-TOKENROLES LIST](https://www.vibrantnet.io/documentation/configure-tokenroles-list) command.

| Parameter    | Details                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| policy-id    | Policy ID to add as an official token policy on this server. |
| project-name | The project name to list this policy ID under.               |

&#x20;Please ensure you are not impersonating other projects under false pretenses. While we support cross-project collaborations, misrepresentation of your own server as an official server of another project or malicious use of policy IDs will lead to your Discord server being blacklisted for the use of Vibrant.
