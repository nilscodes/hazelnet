# ðŸ—‘ /configure-policyid remove

The command /CONFIGURE-POLICY REMOVE can be used to remove registered policies on your Discord server from the official list that can be viewed via [/POLICYID](https://www.vibrantnet.io/documentation/policyid). Simply pass the policy ID as the parameter (each policy can only be added once) and the respective project will be removed from all other commands that use project names.

| Parameter | Details                                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| policy-id | Policy ID to remove as official token policy from this server. |
