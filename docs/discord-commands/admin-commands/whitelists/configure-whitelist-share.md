<mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark>

<mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-WHITELIST SHARE</mark> provides you an easy way to implement cross-project whitelists. For example, your community can sign up on your own server for a whitelist for a different project, and you can allow the other project to access your whitelist data without having to send it to them. This enables cross-project promotions that engage communities across Discord server boundaries.

Simply share an existing whitelist by running the command and providing the correct guild ID (see parameter description on how to retrieve that ID). The other team can then download individual whitelists via <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-WHITELIST DOWNLOAD</mark> or all shared whitelists at once via our REST API, accessible through <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-API GENERATETOKEN</mark>.
