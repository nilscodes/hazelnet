<mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark>

There are multiple ways to retrieve your whitelist signups from Vibrant, but an easy one is to use the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-WHITELIST DOWNLOAD</mark> command. Running it will prompt you for the whitelist for which you'd like to download data. Once you have selected a whitelist, it will provide a download link to a CSV file (that can be opened with any text editor or spreadsheet application like Google Sheets or Microsoft ExcelÂ®).

The command lets you download your own whitelist, as well as any whitelists other servers have shared with you via <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-WHITELIST SHARE</mark>.

&#x20;If you want an automated way to download whitelists to integrate with your website or minting system, you can alternatively use <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-API GENERATETOKEN</mark> to get access to the public API of Vibrant.
