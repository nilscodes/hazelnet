description: Reopen a previously closed whitelist

# ðŸšª /configure-whitelist open

<mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark>

If you have closed a whitelist previously, you can easily reopen it with <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-WHITELIST OPEN</mark>. An opened whitelist will be available for signups immediately.

âš  Opening a whitelist does not change the end date on it, which means if the end date is in the past, the open command will not allow users to sign up again.
