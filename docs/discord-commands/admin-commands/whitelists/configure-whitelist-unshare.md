description: Unshare a previously shared whitelist

# ðŸš« /configure-whitelist unshare

<mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark>

If you have shared a whitelist with the wrong server or would like to unshare a whitelist for other reasons, you can easily run the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-WHITELIST UNSHARE</mark> command. It will provide you with a list of whitelists and servers they are shared with and you can simply unshare by selecting the correct one.

ðŸ’¡ While you can unshare a whitelist, we cannot guarantee that the server you have shared with has not already downloaded the whitelist data. If you are unsharing because you did not want to share a list that you are still collecting signups for, make sure to let the other team know that more data will come later.
