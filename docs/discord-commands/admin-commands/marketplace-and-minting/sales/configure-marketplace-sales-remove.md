# ðŸ—‘ /configure-marketplace sales remove

<mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark>

<mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-MARKETPLACE SALES REMOVE</mark> provides you with quick and easy way to remove existing sales trackers. After running the command you will be prompted to choose the sales tracker to remove, and once selected, the tracker will immediately stop posting to the designated channel. Any settings or metadata filters will be removed along with the tracker.

ðŸ’¡ The dropdown list does not contain any metadata filter information. If you have multiple trackers for the same project with different metadata filters, make sure to run <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-MARKETPLACE SALES LIST</mark> first and write down the exact tracker ID to select in the dropdown.
