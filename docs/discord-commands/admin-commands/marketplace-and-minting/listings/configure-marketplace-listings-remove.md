# ðŸ—‘ /configure-marketplace listings remove

Black Edition

/CONFIGURE-MARKETPLACE LISTINGS REMOVE provides you with quick and easy way to remove existing listing trackers. After running the command you will be prompted to choose the listing tracker to remove, and once selected, the tracker will immediately stop posting to the designated channel. Any settings or metadata filters will be removed along with the tracker.

&#x20;The dropdown list does not contain any metadata filter information. If you have multiple trackers for the same project with different metadata filters, make sure to run [/CONFIGURE-MARKETPLACE LISTINGS LIST](https://www.vibrantnet.io/documentation/configure-marketplace-listings-list) first and write down the exact tracker ID to select in the dropdown.
