<mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark>

Set up a listing tracker for any of your official policy IDs in seconds with <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-MARKETPLACE LISTINGS ADD</mark>. Simply choose your marketplace, minimum price and channel for the bot to post in, and select your project in the next step. Once the tracker is set up, it will immediately post any new listings matching the required criteria in the designated channel. Before you can add a tracker, the respective policy and project name must have been added via <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-POLICY ADD</mark>.

&#x20;You can add additional criteria like only showing listings for specific traits by adding filters via our famous metadata filter system. Simply use <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-MARKETPLACE METADATAFILTER ADD</mark> after adding the initial listing tracker and choose your filter settings.

&#x20;By default, there is a limit of five listing trackers per server. Should you need more trackers, contact us in our Support Discord and provide your Discord server ID.
