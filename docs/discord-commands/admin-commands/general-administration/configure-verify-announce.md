# âœ” /configure-verify announce

In your Discord you will want the simplest steps for your users to verify and connect with your community. The command <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-VERIFY ANNOUNCE</mark> will give you exactly that, and more! With a dedicated widget just to have your users start the verification process with a single click. If they are already users of the bot on other Discords, their account will be linked within seconds and they will immediately receive their current eligible roles. Otherwise it will tell them how to start the normal verification process described in <mark style="background-color:orange;">/VERIFY ADD</mark>.

ðŸ’¡ You will need to give the bot the right permissions to post to the channel, but you will be informed if the permissions are lacking.
