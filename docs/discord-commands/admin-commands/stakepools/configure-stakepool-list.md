# ðŸ“ƒ /configure-stakepool list

For Discords that run a stakepool or even just support certain stakepools in the Cardano ecosystem, <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-STAKEPOOL LIST</mark> can be used by administrators to get a list of all stakepools that have been added to this server. Any stakepools added via <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFGURE-STAKEPOOL ADD</mark> will be listed here. They will also be available for your normal users via the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/INFO</mark> command.\
