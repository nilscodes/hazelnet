# ðŸ”— /configure-poll add-onchain

With the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-POLL ADD-ONCHAIN</mark> command you can effortlessly incorporate the on-chain voting system [Voteaire ](https://voteaire.io/) into your Discord.

After creating the ballot on the above website, you can present the poll in your community with this command and publish a widget that lets users see the current results and immediately go to the ballot website to cast their vote, if the ballot is still open. To get started, you only need your Voteaire ballot ID, which you can find in the Hyperlink to your ballot.

&#x20;While Voteaire currently supports multiple questions per ballot, the bot can currently only display the first question and its results.
