# ðŸ§ª /configure-tokenroles test

When setting up roles and testing if your configuration is correct, or when dealing with community member questions about their roles, it is often helpful to know what roles a user currently would be assigned and why. With <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-TOKENROLES TEST</mark> you have an easy way at your fingertips to find out if a user has verified their wallet properly and which roles they should actually have. If they are missing roles that you recently changed or because they have not been patient enough to wait, you even have the option to assign their eligible roles with the click of a button.
