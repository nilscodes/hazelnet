<mark style="background-color:red;">Black Edition</mark>

To delete a giveaway and all entries and winner information along with it, run the command <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-GIVEAWAY REMOVE</mark>. Do not use the command unless you have published your winners or written them down if you believe you will still need them. After running the command, you will be prompted for a list of available giveaways to delete. Once the selection is made, the giveaway is immediately removed.

&#x20;When deleting a giveaway, any scheduled or manual announcements created via <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-GIVEAWAY ANNOUNCE</mark> will remain unchanged.
