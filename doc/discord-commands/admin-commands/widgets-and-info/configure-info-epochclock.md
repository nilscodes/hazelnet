description: Turn a voice channel into an Epoch Clock
---

# âŒš /configure-info epochclock

If you need to track what Cardano Epoch it is or how much time is left in the current Epoch, you can simply turn any voice channel into an Epoch Clock. Run /CONFIGURE-INFO EPOCHCLOCK and designate which channel, and you are good to go!

ðŸ’¡ The bot will continuously need the View Channel, Manage Channel and Connect permissions to the respective voice channel to be able to update its name. The name change to the currently remaining Epoch time happens every five minutes at most, due to the rate limits that Discord has put in place.
