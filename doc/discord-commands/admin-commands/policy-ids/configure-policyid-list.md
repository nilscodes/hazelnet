# ðŸ“ƒ /configure-policyid list

With <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-POLICY LIST</mark> administrators can see the list of all the NFT and fungible token projects that have been added to your server. Each project contains the Cardano policy ID as well as a readable project name that you can define however you want. Your users will be able to see this same list with the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/POLICYID</mark> command.

âš  Please ensure you are not impersonating other projects under false pretenses. While we support cross-project collaborations, misrepresentation of your own server as an official server of another project or malicious use of policy IDs will lead to your Discord server being blacklisted for the use of Vibrant.
