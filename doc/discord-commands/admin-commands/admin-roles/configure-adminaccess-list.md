# ðŸ“ƒ /configure-adminaccess list

In addition to the built-in Discord permissions, Vibrant limits the use of all administrative commands to a pre-defined set of roles in your Discord. If you would like to see which roles can access your administrative commands (the ones starting with /CONFIGURE-â€¦), you can run <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-ADMINACCESS LIST</mark> to see all roles with elevated privileges.
