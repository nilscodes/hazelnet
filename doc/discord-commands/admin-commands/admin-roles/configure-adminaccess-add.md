# ðŸ”’ /configure-adminaccess add

If you want to add additional roles to your Vibrant administrators, you can simply add them via <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-ADMINACCESS ADD</mark>. The role will immediately be able to use any of the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-â€¦</mark> commands, provided you have also given them command permissions.

âš  If a user reports that they cannot use the administrative commands even though you have their role assigned as administrator, make sure they also have the Discord-based command permissions. Go to **Server Settings âž¡ Integrations âž¡ Vibrant Community System** and find the commands they need access to. In that User Interface, you can now enable their individual permissions based on the role they have.
