# ⏹ /configure-giveaway end

Black Edition

Once your giveaway end time is reached or you want to end an open giveaway, <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-GIVEAWAY END</mark> lets you draw the winners and close a still-open giveaway for any further participation.

After ending the giveaway, the winner data will be shown, depending on what type of drawing you have selected. If you have select Discord information as the drawing type, you will also be able to immediately publish the winners to any existing announcement widget. If address data is drawn for the winners, any announcement will have to be done manually.

⚠ Double-check any winning wallet addresses for known scammers or suspicious activity before sending anything.
