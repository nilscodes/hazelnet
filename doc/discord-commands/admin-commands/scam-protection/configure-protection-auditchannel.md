# ðŸ‘‚ /configure-protection auditchannel

Once you have turned on scam protection features, you can enable your community management and moderator teams to act on suspicious messages even easier. Simply turn on auditing via <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CONFIGURE-PROTECTION AUDITCHANNEL</mark>. With this turned on and the right permissions set for the bot (Send Messages), you are now able to see any messages the bot removes, as well as their author. Your team can now easily determine if the user accidentally posted an address or if a malicious person or bot is trying to scam your community and you want to take your banhammer ðŸ”¨ to good use.
