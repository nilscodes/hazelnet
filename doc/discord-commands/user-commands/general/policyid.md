# ðŸ›¡ /policyid

For NFT and projects with fungible tokens, the <mark style="background-color:orange;">/POLICYID</mark> command will list every policy ID the operators of this Discord server have added as official policies in alphabetical order. Each entry will include a policy ID and project name.

&#x20;ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind: This does not mean that this is the official Discord for the respective projects, but that the administrators of this server added them as policies here. Please verify on the respective project website, if you are on their official Discord server before following any buy links etc.
