# ðŸ›’ /claim

If you are on a server that has physical items to claim with your NFTs, or physical item airdrops based on NFT ownership, the command <mark style="background-color:orange;">/CLAIM</mark> will be available to you. You only need to run the command if the project team instructs you to, as many projects do not yet have any physical goods.

ðŸ’¡ The command itself will guide you through any active claims you have, and if any type of personal data has to be submitted to fulfill the order, the bot will try to message you directly on Discord. If you have chosen to not accept direct messages on the server, the bot will let you know that you have to adjust this setting under **Privacy Settings**.
